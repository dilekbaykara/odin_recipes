    <h2>Description</h2>
<p> Easy favorite, takes about 30 mins</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Kosher salt (Diamond Crystal)</li>
<li>1 ½ pounds fresh or frozen udon noodles (vacuum-sealed)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as vegetable or grapeseed</li>
<li>1 pound cremini mushrooms, stemmed and sliced into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
<li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
<li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
<li>4 tablespoons butter, preferably salted (see Tip)</li>
<li>½ small head Napa cabbage, finely sliced (about 1 pound)</li>
<li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>2 scallions, finely sliced</li>
<li> 1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the udon noodles and cook for about 2 minutes, using wooden chopsticks or tongs to gently loosen the noodles from their tight bundle. Drain, rinse with cold water and leave to continue draining while you prepare the remaining ingredients.</li>
<br>
<li>Heat a wok or large (12-inch) skillet on medium-high, until very hot. Add oil and mushrooms, and stir-fry for 7 to 8 minutes, leaving undisturbed for 30 seconds to 1 minute at a time, to allow them to caramelize. (Be patient: They will release a lot of liquid, then start to brown.) Add the garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few turns of black pepper. Drizzle the mushrooms with 2 tablespoons of honey, then add 3 tablespoons of butter and toss.</li>
<br>
<li>Add the udon noodles, Napa cabbage and soy sauce to the pan, then toss for 2 minutes, until the cabbage is wilted and everything is well combined. Remove from the heat and add the remaining 1 tablespoon honey and 1 tablespoon butter. Taste and season with more salt and black pepper, if required. To serve, scatter with scallions and sesame seeds.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Tip</h2>
<p><em>If using unsalted butter, add an additional 1/4 teaspoon of salt in Step 2.</em></p>
